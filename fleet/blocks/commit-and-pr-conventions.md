## Commit and PR conventions

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`. Valid types: `feat`,
  `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`.
- Commits require DCO sign-off. Make all commits with `git commit -s` (enforced
  by the `.githooks/commit-msg` hook; run `just install-hooks` once per clone).
- Do not identify an AI tool or model as an author, co-author, committer, or
  signatory of a commit. Do not name an AI tool or model in `Co-authored-by`,
  `Assisted-by`, `Co-developed-by`, `Generated-by`, or similar trailers. Human
  `Co-authored-by` trailers are allowed.
- Never commit directly to `main`; create a feature branch and open a PR.
- PR descriptions should contain a concise summary of changes and any required
  AI/LLM disclosure. Do not add a standalone test-plan section.
- When AI/LLM was used to generate or assist with a pull request, disclose the
  tool and model in the initial PR description, briefly describe its role, and
  state how the output was reviewed or verified.
- Keep AI/LLM disclosure factual and concise. Do not add promotional
  "generated with" footers.
- Keep each prose paragraph in a PR description on one source line. Do not
  hard-wrap PR body prose like a commit message; preserve intentional Markdown
  line breaks in lists, code blocks, and other structured content.
- Comments must earn their keep: a comment states a constraint or rationale the
  code cannot express. Never add comments that narrate what the code does,
  restate names, or explain a change to its reviewer.
